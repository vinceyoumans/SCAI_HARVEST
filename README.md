# SCAI_HARVEST

I was plannig on rebuilding my old iPHONE and ANDROID versions of this
SCAI APP, as the original iPHONE and ANDROID versions expired.
Using the original PHP server back end.
But the system ws so old, with a lot of legacy features no one wanted
that I thought now would be a good time to rebuild the system from
Scratch using FireStore as a back end.

So I created some custom end points on the PHP system to extract the 
Most valuable data.  This collection of GoLang programs uses these end points
to create a new Data Structure for the new system

It is also the begining of Version4, which will use FireStore as a 
Back end.

I did not polish the code well, as I am only going to use it once.
zzNEW directory has the final version of the code.

I am also using Google Firebase ADMINSDK with Google.
